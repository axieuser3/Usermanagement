# Account Deletion and Re-signup Prevention System

## üî• CRITICAL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

This system prevents trial abuse by tracking deleted accounts and preventing users from getting multiple free trials by re-signing up.

## üìã System Overview

### Core Problem Solved
- **Trial Abuse Prevention**: Users cannot sign up multiple times to get unlimited free trials
- **Account History Tracking**: All deleted accounts are permanently tracked
- **Subscription Enforcement**: Returning users must subscribe to regain access
- **Data Protection**: Once deleted, account data cannot be restored unless they subscribe

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Table: `deleted_account_history`
```sql
CREATE TABLE deleted_account_history (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    original_user_id uuid NOT NULL,     -- Original user ID before deletion
    email text NOT NULL UNIQUE,         -- Email (primary identifier)
    full_name text,
    
    -- Trial tracking
    trial_used boolean DEFAULT true,     -- Did they use their free trial?
    trial_start_date timestamptz,
    trial_end_date timestamptz,
    trial_completed boolean DEFAULT false,
    
    -- Subscription history
    ever_subscribed boolean DEFAULT false,
    last_subscription_status text,
    subscription_cancelled_date timestamptz,
    
    -- Deletion tracking
    account_deleted_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    deletion_reason text DEFAULT 'trial_expired',
    
    -- Re-signup prevention
    can_get_new_trial boolean DEFAULT false,           -- Always false
    requires_immediate_subscription boolean DEFAULT true, -- Always true
    
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## üîß Key Functions

### 1. `check_email_trial_history(email)`
**Purpose**: Check if an email has been used before
**Returns**: Trial history, subscription requirements, deletion info

### 2. `record_account_deletion(user_id, email, reason)`
**Purpose**: Record account deletion in history table
**Called**: Automatically when accounts are deleted

### 3. `handle_user_resignup(user_id, email)`
**Purpose**: Handle re-signup attempts
**Logic**:
- If email found in deletion history ‚Üí NO TRIAL, immediate subscription required
- If new email ‚Üí Normal 7-day trial

### 4. `safely_delete_user_account(user_id)`
**Purpose**: Safely delete account with history tracking
**Process**:
1. Record deletion history
2. Delete user account
3. Cascade deletes related data

### 5. `restore_account_on_subscription(user_id, stripe_customer_id, subscription_id)`
**Purpose**: Restore access when returning user subscribes
**Process**:
1. Activate account
2. Grant pro access
3. Update deletion history

## üîÑ User Journey Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User
1. User signs up with new email
2. `handle_user_resignup()` finds no history
3. User gets 7-day free trial
4. Normal trial countdown begins

### Scenario 2: Trial Expires (No Subscription)
1. Trial countdown reaches 0
2. Account scheduled for deletion
3. `safely_delete_user_account()` called
4. Account deleted, history recorded in `deleted_account_history`

### Scenario 3: User Re-signs Up (Same Email)
1. User tries to sign up with same email
2. `handle_user_resignup()` finds deletion history
3. Account created with:
   - `account_status = 'expired'`
   - `access_level = 'none'`
   - `has_access = false`
   - `trial_days_remaining = 0`
4. User sees "Subscribe to continue" message
5. NO FREE TRIAL GRANTED

### Scenario 4: Returning User Subscribes
1. User with expired account subscribes
2. `restore_account_on_subscription()` called
3. Account restored with:
   - `account_status = 'active'`
   - `access_level = 'pro'`
   - `has_access = true`
4. Full access granted

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Admin Protection
- Super admin (UID: b8782453-a343-4301-a947-67c5bb407d2b) cannot be deleted
- Multiple safety checks prevent accidental admin deletion

### Data Integrity
- Deletion history is permanent and cannot be modified by users
- Only admin can view deletion history
- System functions control all deletion tracking

### Trial Abuse Prevention
- Email-based tracking prevents multiple accounts
- History survives account deletion
- No way to reset trial status

## üîç Monitoring & Admin Tools

### Check User History
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_email_trial_history('user@example.com');
```

### View All Deleted Accounts (Admin Only)
```sql
SELECT * FROM deleted_account_history ORDER BY account_deleted_at DESC;
```

### Verify User Protection
```sql
SELECT * FROM verify_user_protection('user-uuid');
```

### System Health Check
```sql
SELECT check_database_health();
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Data Recovery
- **Once deleted, user data CANNOT be restored**
- Only account access can be restored via subscription
- This is by design for data protection

### Email Uniqueness
- System tracks by email address
- Same email = same trial history
- Users cannot circumvent by using same email

### Subscription Requirement
- Returning users MUST subscribe to continue
- No exceptions or grace periods
- Immediate subscription required for access

## üöÄ Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Functions**: All 5 critical functions implemented
‚úÖ **Triggers**: Enhanced user creation trigger with re-signup detection
‚úÖ **Security**: RLS policies and admin protection
‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Health checks and admin tools

## üîß Testing Scenarios

1. **Test New User**: Verify normal trial works
2. **Test Trial Expiration**: Verify account gets deleted and recorded
3. **Test Re-signup**: Verify no trial granted, subscription required
4. **Test Subscription**: Verify access restoration works
5. **Test Admin Protection**: Verify admin cannot be deleted

This system ensures complete trial abuse prevention while maintaining data integrity and user experience.
