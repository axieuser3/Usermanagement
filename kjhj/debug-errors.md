# Debug Errors Checklist

## Fixed Issues âœ…

1. **Environment Variables Types** - Added proper TypeScript definitions in `vite-env.d.ts`
2. **Database Query Fix** - Fixed `useUserAccess` hook to use correct views (`user_trial_info` and `stripe_user_subscriptions`)
3. **Missing View Issue** - Replaced non-existent `user_access_status` with proper database queries

## Common TypeScript Errors to Check in Bolt:

### 1. Import/Export Issues
- Check if all imported components exist
- Verify export statements match import statements

### 2. Type Mismatches
- Environment variables should now have proper types
- Database queries should match schema definitions

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- All required packages are in package.json
- React, TypeScript, Supabase, Lucide icons are included

### 4. Configuration Issues
- TypeScript config is properly set up
- Vite config should work with React + TypeScript

## Testing in Bolt:

1. **Push this code to GitHub**
2. **Import into Bolt IDE**
3. **Check the Problems panel** for specific error messages
4. **Look for these common issues:**
   - Red squiggly lines under imports
   - Type errors in components
   - Missing environment variable types

## If Errors Persist:

1. **Check specific error messages** in Bolt's Problems panel
2. **Look for missing files** that are being imported
3. **Verify database schema** matches the queries in hooks
4. **Check if all environment variables** are properly typed

## Most Likely Remaining Issues:

1. **Database Views Missing** - The app expects certain views to exist in Supabase
2. **Supabase Functions Not Deployed** - Edge functions need to be deployed
3. **Environment Variables** - Some variables might be missing in Bolt

## Next Steps:

1. Push to GitHub and test in Bolt
2. Check the specific error messages
3. Focus on database setup if queries fail
4. Deploy Supabase functions if API calls fail
